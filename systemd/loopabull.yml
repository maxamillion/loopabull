# There are three main definitions: ansible, routing_keys, plugin. These will be
# explained in comments above each section below.

# plugin

# This is the selected plugin that will interface with your prefered origin of
# events (message bus or otherwise).
plugin: fedmsg

# routing_keys

# This is a list of routing keys that will be yielded by your selected plugin
# that should be acted upon (i.e. - these keys should trigger an ansible
# playbook by the same name).
routing_keys:

#     coorelate to the routing_keys
#
#   cfg_file_path
#     Full path location of the ansible configuration to use
#
#   playbook_cmd
#     Command to use in place of ansible-playbook (for those that want to use
#     Ansible Tower commands or custom wrappers of their own)
