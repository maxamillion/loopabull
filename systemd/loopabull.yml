#
#   looper: message bus python generator plugin that will interface with your
#           prefered origin of events (message bus or otherwise).
#
#   translator: routing key translator which allows for alternative layouts
#               on-disk for routing_key mappings to playbooks the default of
#               "rkname" simple means that your playbooks share the same parent
#               dir and are all named after the routing_key they correspond to
#               in the message bus.
#

# This is a list of routing keys that will be yielded by your selected plugin
# that should be acted upon (i.e. - these keys should trigger an ansible
# playbook by the same name).
